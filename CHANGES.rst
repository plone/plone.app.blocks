  [datakurre]


4.0.0 (2016-12-13)
------------------

Incompatibilities:

- Remove grid transform, because it did not serve its purpose as as well
  expected and required HTML-syntax not editable by humans; Instead using
  grid framework agnostic CSS class names and building CSS grid against
  those class names is recommended
  [agitator]

- Remove ``IOmittedField`` marker from layout behavior fields not meant to be
  displayed on legacy Deco UIs
  [jensens]

- Rename ``ILayoutAware.content`` to ``ILayoutAware.customContentLayout``
  [datakurre]

- Move functions ``getDefaultAjaxLayout``, ``getDefaultSiteLayout``,
  ``getLayout`` and ``getLayoutAwareSiteLayout`` to ``.layoutbehavior`` in
  order to avoid circular imports (all deprecated now, see section New).
  [jensens]

- Move views from ``.layoutbehavior`` to new module ``.layoutviews`` in order
  to avoid circular imports.  Deprecated deferred imports are in place.
  [jensens]

New:

- Add ``ILayoutAware.content`` as layout independent "layout like" tile
  configuration and data storage for all serializable tile configurations
  [datakurre]

- Add ``@@layout_preview`` view for previewing currently drafted layout aware
  content
  [datakurre]

- ``ILayoutAware`` is now also responsible to lookup the behaviors.
  [jensens]

- Get layouts always by adapting with ``ILayoutAware``.  This introduces a
  generic adapter and a behavior adapter.  Deprecated the formerly used functions
  ``getLayout`` ``getDefaultSiteLayout`` just calls
  ``ILayoutAware().site_layout`` and is deprected.  ``getLayout`` just calls
  ``ILayoutAware().content_layout`` and is deprecated.
  [jensens]

- Behavior shortname ``plone.layoutaware`` added.
  [jensens]

Fixes:

- Handle missing content layouts so they do not cause an error
  [vangheem]

- A tile raising an 401 Unauthorized on traversal,
  results in a status rewriting to a 302 which results in 200 login form.
  The whole login form page then is rendered as the tile contents.
  This patch catches the 401 by providing a custom exception handler.
  The 401 is catched and ignored. This is not pefect yet and need some work,
  but it at least does not break design and intended behavior of tiles.
  [jensens]

Refactoring:

- Housekeeping: ZCA decorators, sorted imports, line-lengths and related.
  [jensens]

- Reformat documentation.
  [gforcada]

- Update travis configuration.
  [gforcada]
